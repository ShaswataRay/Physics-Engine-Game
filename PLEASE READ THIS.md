This is a cricket game where you are the bowler.
You hit the wickets, you get a point.
Batsman hits the ball, he gets a point.
Make 30 wickets by not allowing the batsman to hit the ball.
GAME BECOMES MORE FUN IF YOU TOUCH THE PITCH FIRST AND THEN THE BALL HITS!
Play with your Family and Friends.
Enjoy :)

(NOTE: The ball should hit the ball to the batsman hard for the batsman to make runs)
